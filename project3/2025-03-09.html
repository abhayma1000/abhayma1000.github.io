<h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Worked with Nick Tomasetti and Sam Nguyen on deriving insights from the yelp dataset</p>
    <p>Tasked with 1. Predict categories based on review data and 2. Predict closure from review data and business metadata</p>
<h1>Details</h1>
    <p>See github and paper for more details</p>
<h1>What I learned</h1>
    <p>Learned how to use pytorch. Have used tensorflow/keras before, but this was my first time using pytorch</p>
    <p>Worked with BERT model and transformers so learned how to take that and then build on it and fine tune it. We added layers and concatenated layers, so got difficult</p>
    <p>When using the big dataset, ran out of memory, so had to use the WPI ARC Turing cluster to preprocess data and train the model</p>
    <p>Refined pandas and other data science skills</p>
