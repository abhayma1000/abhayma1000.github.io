# How To Guide
Make a new project:
* Create an entry in ```projects.json``` file with picture, links, etc.
* Create a new folder and have the main ```project<num>/project<num>.html``` file
    * Can copy from project1.html but change the id number in the js
* Create versions of the main page with the date. Ex: ```2025-01-01.html```

Make a new connection:
* Create an entry in ```connections.json``` file with picture, links, etc.

# Development

Run ```sudo python3 -m http.server 800``` to start a server and launch the ```index.html``` page on a browser
