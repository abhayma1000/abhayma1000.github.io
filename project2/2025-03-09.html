<h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>BoodaTrack is a software application that utilizes AI to analyze a player's badminton play</p>
    <p>The app specializes in analyzing footwork specifically and using AI to derive specific insights like flagging play that increases chance of injury</p>
    <p>The app is structured as a team platform where team users can log in, upload footage, and have it analyzed and sorted by tournament, player, etc.</p>
<h1>Current Development</h1>
    <p>This is a project I started in January 2025 and have been working on in my freetime</p>
    <p>It includes features like injury prevention and player tracking over time</p>
<h1>Future</h1>
    <p>I am making more analysis features currently</p>
    <p>Also, I am working on making it a more robust framework, look nicer, and be easy to use from a team perspective</p>
