<h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>For 2.5 years in high school, worked on model rockets</p>
    <p>#d Printed parts and integrated electronics like microcontroller, altimeter, GPS, gyroscope</p>
<h1>Details</h1>
    <p>Started with fully 3D printed rocket running off of an A engine. Anyone with a brain cell knows that the heavy weight of additive manufactured plastic combined with a weak engine means the rocket goes nowhere</p>
    <p>I tried custom solutions for body, nose cone, parachute, fins, etc.</p>
    <p>I iteratively got rid of custom parts for more off-shelf and lighter components and increased the engine strength and started getting pretty good heights</p>
    <p>Iterated through different nosecones, trying different aerosynamic profiles and simulating through OpenRocket before deploying. Also iterated through many custom parts to hold the engine in place</p>
    <p>Started putting electronics in the bay and 3D printing custom solutions to hold them in (got pretty difficult)</p>
    <p>Able to get GPS, Raspberry pi pico, altimeter, gyroscope, and RF module to communicate to ground station</p>
<h1>What I learned</h1>
    <p>Instead of vertically integrating first, horizontally integrate first and slowly vertically integrate. However for learning purposes, glad I tried to do everything first</p>
    <p>Test everything. I remember testing the sensors and parachute by just throwing it off my balcony. Saves so much time rather than going to launch, realizing it doesn't work, and not knowing why</p>
    <p>Test at different stages. Test everything layed out, test by just dropping it, test in a rocket and dropping, then test the real thing. Test different stages</p>
