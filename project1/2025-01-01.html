<h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>The purpose here is to create a personal website that can be a central location holding everything about me</p>
    <p>Resumes, repos, and other online accounts can all link here as a general site about me</p>
<h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>This is a central location for documenting my projects and importantly giving pointers to githubs or where to learn more</p>
    <p>These are mostly professional projects, but I hope to keep track of personal projects</p>
<h1>Connections</h1>
    <p>I am trying to expand my social media presence and influence and this website directs to all of them</p>
<h1>Development</h1>
    <p>Web development, especially front-end is not my strong-suit. While I can use flask to make a backend, I cannot do front end html, css, js well</p>
    <p>I made a pre-defined css template (thanks ChatGPT) and am pretty much going to stick to it for this project</p>
    <p>Also, I host this on github.io so I have little option when it comes to advanced features</p>
    <p>The website uses a modular system for adding projects and connections so the process of adding new ones should be easy</p>
<h1>Future</h1>
    <p>I will keep this up to date with my projects and updates</p>
    <p>I hope to keep adding new features like maybe a blog section to this website, but as the tag says, this is not a high priority</p>
    <p>Also, I hope to make pages more dynamic with pictures, videos even, etc.</p>
